### Description
VisualMouse is free software that lets you replace your computer's mouse actions with your hand.
Indeed, you can move the mouse, trigger a left or right click and all the associated subsidiary actions.

### Requirements
In order to use the software on your computer, it must meet several requirements:
- **Operating system:**
Linux, Windows, MacOS
- **Internet:**
not required
- **Administrator rights:**
not required

### Installation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> *The software currently works with Python version 3.11.x*

#### Windows/Linux/MacOS - Clone the repository

**1.** To install VisualMouse on your computer, you need to clone the [repository](https://github.com/LeonPupier/VisualMouse.git).

**2.** Before you can launch the software, you must install its dependencies.
Nothing could be simpler, just run this command at the root of the folder:

> [!NOTE]
> *Please note that depending on the configuration, the "python3" command may be replaced by "python" or even "py".*

```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
**3.** You can now run the main file of the program with Python:
```
python3 tutorial.py
```

**3.1** If you want to use *VisualMouse* without the tutorial at the beginning, run this command instead:
```
python3 app.py
```

You are now ready to use VisualMouse!

### Informations
I am working on an executable version of the software.
